I created Online Clothing Shop project to learn how to work with Redux.js.

* The project is based on React & Redux.js.
* The project contains the base of 35 clothing items by different categories & order option.
* You can filter items using category buttons ("Women", "Kids", "Pants" etc.)
* Redux implementattion allows to add items to cart / remove from cart, to choose the sixe of item, to change quantity of item and as a result to see the Total price for the order.
